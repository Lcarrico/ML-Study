# Machine Learning Study

This study will be dedicated to developing skill in different machine learning applications. This will build and develop all the necessary skills to form a full stack for a career as a *Data Scientist*.

This study will complete the chapters and exercises from the following book:

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/"><img src="images/hands-on-book-cover.jpg" alt="Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron" width=400px></a>

Some code examples will be taken graciously from [the author's repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2).

This repository will have notes that may be considered **supplemental** material for the already existing chapters in the book. If you wish to have full knowledge and intuition on implementing machine learning algorithms, please support the author and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/"> purchase the book</a>.
