# The Machine Learning Landscape

## What is Machine Learning?

- Machine Learning is creating programs that can solve problems by teaching themselves how to solve those problems through data or information.

## Why use Machine Learning?

- Machine Learning can more efficiently solve problems that have a multitude of rules by learning those rules itself, or even solve problems whose rules are not fully known. 

## Types of Machine Learning Systems

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Semisupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Batch Learning
- Online Learning
- Instance-Based Learning
- Model-Based Learning
